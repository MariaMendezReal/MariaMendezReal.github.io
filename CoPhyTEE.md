## Addressing Covert & Physical Attacks performed from SW in Open-Hardware Trusted Execution Environment-enabled System-on-Chip 

### ANR-23-CE39-0003 ANR-23-CE39-0003-01

Today’s System-on-Chip (SoC) include advanced features that allow for dynamic energy-management to
better adapt to current computation loads, heat, and required performance and energy constraints. However,
an emergent category of attacks has shown that these features can be maliciously exploited to perform
internal attacks (i.e., attacks performed by software co-located with sensitive applications on the same
hardware), even circumventing Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) security guarantees. Reported
attacks include covert channels, Side-Channel Attacks (SCA) and Fault Injection (FI) by exploiting the
frequency, voltage, temperature, current, and power supply. Although totally disabling energy-management
mechanisms would limit and avoid most vulnerabilities, this would go against the performance and energy
optimizations, achieved gains, and might lead to significant overheads.
Instead of limiting or disabling these optimization mechanisms, in CoPhyTEE, we propose to benefit
from them to built a security governor able to detect at run-time possible vulnerable execution scenarios,
