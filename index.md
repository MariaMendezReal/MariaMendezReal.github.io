Short bio
-------
Originally from Mexico, Maria Méndez Real spent one year in the United States and lives in France since 2009.<br/>
Since September 2018, Maria Méndez Real is Associate Professor (*Maitre de Conférences*) at Polytech Université de Nantes, France. Since 2014 she has been working in Hardware Security. Her reasearch activity is within IETR (*Institut d’Electronique et des Technologies du numéRique*, UMR CNRS 6164) lab. Her research interests include side-channel attacks, fault and remote attacks, embedded systems, multi and many-core systems and protoyping tools.<br/>
From 2017 to 2018 she was an Assistant Professor (*ATER*) at Polytech Université de Nantes.<br/>
In 2015 she was invited researcher at the Ruhr-University of Bochum (RUB), Germany. She worked on virtual prototyping tools for multi core architectures.<br/>
In 2017, she received her PhD, european label, in Electronic Engineering - Hardware Security from UBS (*Université de Bretagne-Sud*), within Lab-STICC UMR 6285 lab in France. Her PhD work was on the frame of the French ANR TSUNAMY project (2013-2017) and deal with secure-enable mechanisms for the spatial isolation of sensitive applications on many-core architectures.<br/>
Before that, she received her master (Dipl.-Ing.) in Electrical and Computer from UBS in 2014.<br/>
She is author and co-author in international journals, conferences and workshops (TECS, TC, DATE, JSA, FPL, SAMOS, VLSI, etc). She is PC member and reviwer of several international journals and conferences (Journal of Cryptography, DATE, NEWCAS, FPT, TCAD, LASCAS, MCSoC, ICCS, etc).<br/>
She actively participates on national project evaluation (ANR projects, PEC, regional, etc) and jurys for recrutement of Associate Professors and PhD following.
